This example have two services: command and ship
The ship requests command for destination via http://commandcenter:8080/

WHen ship is contacted via its external port http://localhost:8060/
it replies with its status and destination

ports in docker.compose.yaml file means outer:inner

The folders command and ship contains source code
The code is translated to jar files by running "mvn clean install" in each folder
The jar files are then moved to folders ending with -build
docker-compose.yaml uses this jar files for the build

commands for running containers:
docker-compose up --build
http://localhost:8060/
